I found really detailed df of an eletronics store splited in all month during the whole year.
my goal is construct a small story telling considering the price, quantity and time of the sells.


I took a look at all charts. All them contain the following information an Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date, Purchase Address. (PS: in this form one client order can take multiple lines, if they purchase more than one product [a bit more than 500 clients on this situation in Jan])

To have a better view of all and future clean it. I merged all 
Some cleaning was necessary (e.g: drop NaN, when Month = Or, and the title of all merged charts repeated)
With that I was able to answer the following questions:


What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
