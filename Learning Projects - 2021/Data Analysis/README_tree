README


In this little project i want to clean and modify some features.

Street tree data from the TreesCount! 2015 Street Tree Census, conducted by volunteers and staff organized by NYC Parks & Recreation and partner organizations. Tree data collected includes tree species, diameter and perception of health. Accompanying blockface data is available indicating status of data collection and data release citywide. 

after looking a but on the data frame we noitce that the DS has 45 columns 
'tree_id', 'block_id', 'created_at', 'tree_dbh', 'stump_diam',
       'curb_loc', 'status', 'health', 'spc_latin', 'spc_common', 'steward',
       'guards', 'sidewalk', 'user_type', 'problems', 'root_stone',
       'root_grate', 'root_other', 'trunk_wire', 'trnk_light', 'trnk_other',
       'brch_light', 'brch_shoe', 'brch_other', 'address', 'postcode',
       'zip_city', 'community board', 'borocode', 'borough', 'cncldist',
       'st_assem', 'st_senate', 'nta', 'nta_name', 'boro_ct', 'state',
       'latitude', 'longitude', 'x_sp', 'y_sp', 'council district',
       'census tract', 'bin', 'bbl'
       
One can find the description on 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh'

I deleted a few columns that are not that interesting. 
Now I would like to clean the health col. there are many NoN, most of then from tree that are dead or cut (Stump).
Except for one. To not delete those one that i change to 'Good' because it was the most commum answer.

There are few different tree problems that have typos, double answers and more (some more clean are necessary for that)

Then, i restrict the ds for the alives trees and plot a small histogram for fun.
