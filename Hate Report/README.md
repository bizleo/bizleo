## Project Title: Hate Speech Detection on 9GAG

### Overview
This project aims to analyze posts and comments on 9GAG, an online platform known for memes and entertainment content, to detect potential hate speech. Using a Python client or web scraping the program will fetch a post, analyze its content and comments, and determine if it includes any hate speech. If hate speech is detected, the program will log details about the post and potentially trigger a reporting mechanism, providing an automated response to harmful content.

### Methodology
Data Collection: A Python client is used to connect to 9GAG and retrieve specific posts for analysis.
Content Analysis: The retrieved content will be processed to detect any indication of hate speech, using text classification techniques or pre-trained machine learning models like some Chatbox API. Specific markers of hate speech will be defined to ensure a consistent detection approach.
Reporting Mechanism: If the content is flagged as hate speech, the program will log relevant information, including the post URL and flagged content. Further, a reporting mechanism may be developed to notify relevant authorities within 9GAG.

### Importance
Hate speech online contributes to a negative user experience and has real-world consequences, as an daily user of 9GAG I fell particularly annoyed by sexist and LGBTphobic content there. Automating the detection and reporting of such content can help online platforms maintain a safe and inclusive environment. This project serves as a prototype for real-world applications in content moderation, showcasing how Python and machine learning can tackle social media toxicity.
